## Description
Challenge 2 -- Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This project was to build a portfolio for my self, which demonstrates my knowlege of advanced CSS, being flexbox, media queries, and accessibility. Through the process of creating this project, I learned much more about flexbox and how to use it with media queries to have the entire webpage with all it's elements strech and shrink depending on how someone is viewing the page and what kind of media screen they're using. I also learned more about CSS variables, and more about universal selectors.
